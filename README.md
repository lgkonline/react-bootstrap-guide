# Install Bootstrap 4 to a React project

Add Bootstrap 4 to your React project to give your app a nice look.

You should already have a React project. Take a look at this guide to learn how to create one: [https://lgkonline.github.io/skill-guide/#/guide/lgkonline/react-guide](https://lgkonline.github.io/skill-guide/#/guide/lgkonline/react-guide)

While I am writing this guide, Bootstrap 4 is still in Beta. You should keep that in mind.
